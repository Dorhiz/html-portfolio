<h1>The best movies acording to Doris</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mulan</h3>
<p>
  It's the first movie I remember to realy relate as a child. I remembered the
  exact feeling I got when she's on the mountains after defeating the huns, and
  she sees herself on the helment.

<h3>White chicks</h3>
<p>So funny... nothing more to say, really.</p>
<h3>Pride and prejudice</h3>
<p>
  When my dad was recovering after being hospitalised we saw together this one a
  bunch of times. Good memories after a bad moment.
